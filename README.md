# iAgent

This repository provides the implementation for ACL 2025 Findings paper "iAgent: LLM Agent as a Shield between User and Recommender Systems".

The traditional recommendation ecosystem primarily focuses on designing sophisticated models to enhance ranking performance, thereby increasing platform benefits. However, these models often neglect the importance of user-driven instructions and put users under the direct control of recommender systems.

In contrast, **iAgent** introduces an individualized, instruction-aware agent for each user, generating re-ranking results based on user instructions. The memory of the agent is influenced solely by the individual user, providing personalized services without external biases.

## üîë Key Features of iAgent

- **New Datasets and Problem**: To establish benchmarks for the new user-agent-platform paradigm, we created four recommendation datasets featuring user-driven instructions, collectively named **InstructRec**. These datasets were constructed from existing resources such as **Amazon**, **Goodreads**, and **Yelp**. We introduce an **Instruction-aware Agent (iAgent)** that learns user interests based on provided free-text instructions while leveraging external knowledge as a domain expert. Unlike constrained instructions in CRS and Webshop, the free-text instructions in InstructRec allow users to express their needs beyond product attributes.

- **üöÄ Agent Learning from Individual Feedback**: We introduce the **Individual Instruction-aware Agent (i<sup>2</sup>Agent)**, which incorporates a dynamic memory mechanism featuring a profile generator and dynamic extractor to further explore user interests. The **profile generator** maintains a user-specific profile using historical information and feedback, while the **dynamic extractor** captures evolving profiles based on real-time instructions. Unlike existing recommendation models, **i<sup>2</sup>Agent** is designed specifically for individual users, ensuring that the interests of less-active users are protected and unaffected by other users.

## üì¶ Requirements

```bash
conda create --name iagent python=3.9
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## üß∞ Usage

### üíæ Dataset Preparation

1. Create a data directory:

```bash
mkdir data/
cd data/
```

2. Download [InstructRec Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-3kHU9D4IH210kSYL-m2cCgWbcY5ilBI?usp=sharing).

```bash
gdown $urls$
```

### üîë  Use with OpenAI API
You need to get your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys.
Then set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
```
